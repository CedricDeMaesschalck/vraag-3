     python-version-file: # optional
    # Used to specify a package manager for caching in the default directory. Supported values: pip, pipenv, poetry.
     cache: # optional
    # The target architecture (x86, x64) of the Python or PyPy interpreter.
     architecture: # optional
    # Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec.
     check-latest: # optional
    # The token used to authenticate when fetching Python distributions from https://github.com/actions/python-versions. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.
     token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}
    # Used to specify the path to dependency files. Supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.
     cache-dependency-path: # optional
    # Set this option if you want the action to update environment variables.
     update-environment: # optional, default is true
    # When 'true', a version range passed to 'python-version' input will match prerelease versions if no GA versions are found. Only 'x.y' version range is supported for CPython.

Available Options:
  warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
  error: Fail the action with an error message
  ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail

    if-no-files-found: # optional, default is warn
    # Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.
Minimum 1 day. Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.

    retention-days: # optional
    # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.

    compression-level: # optional, default is 6
    # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded. If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists. Does not fail if the artifact does not exist.

    overwrite: # optional, default is false
